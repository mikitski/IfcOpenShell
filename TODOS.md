# TODOS

Deferred items surfaced during review, not yet scheduled into an active plan. Each entry captures
enough context that someone picking it up later understands the motivation and starting point.

## IfcOpenShell-TS

Surfaced by `/plan-eng-review` on `planning/ifcopenshell-ts/`, 2026-09-04.

### Phase 0 smoke-test addon: throwaway or foundation?

**What:** Clarify whether Phase 0's smoke-test native-addon binding (`20-roadmap.md` Phase 0,
built with `node-addon-api`) is meant to be discarded once Phase 1's wrappergen-vs-hand-written
spike (`10-architecture.md` §3) picks a direction, or is meant to survive as the foundation either
way.

**Why:** As currently written this is ambiguous. Ambiguity here risks either wasted Phase 0 work
(if the spike picks the generated path and the hand-written smoke test is discarded) or an
accidental premature commitment to hand-written glue before the spike has run.

**Pros:** Cheap to clarify — a one-line decision. Prevents wasted early-phase work.

**Cons:** Minor; doesn't block anything else in the plan regardless of how it's resolved.

**Context:** Phase 0 exists specifically to de-risk the build/CI pipeline before real porting work
starts — it doesn't need to anticipate Phase 1's binding-technology decision, but should be
explicit about not anticipating it.

**Depends on / blocked by:** None. Should be resolved before Phase 0 execution begins.

### ESM vs CJS packaging for the native addon

**What:** Decide whether the published `ifcopenshell` npm package ships as ESM, CJS, or dual-format
(a `package.json` `exports` map with both), and how that interacts with loading a native `.node`
addon — native addons are conventionally loaded via `require()`-style resolution, which has known
friction with pure-ESM packages (the "dual package hazard").

**Why:** Real day-one developer-experience friction. Every consumer's first `npm install && import`
depends on this working correctly regardless of which module system their project uses.

**Pros:** Affects every consumer immediately; getting it right once avoids a stream of "doesn't
work with ESM" / "doesn't work with require" issues.

**Cons:** Well-trodden problem with known solutions in the Node ecosystem — not novel risk, just an
undecided planning gap.

**Context:** `50-repo-and-tooling.md` covers lint/test/versioning/publishing in detail but never
mentions module format. Native-addon-specific ESM/CJS interop patterns are established practice
(e.g. `createRequire` shims, conditional exports) — this is a decision to make, not new territory
to invent.

**Depends on / blocked by:** Should be decided by Phase 0, since it shapes the `package.json`/
package-skeleton work done there.

### LGPL static-linking-through-addon compliance question

**What:** Confirm whether statically linking the LGPL-3.0-or-later C++ core (`src/ifcparse`,
`src/ifcgeom`, etc.) into a native Node addon — versus dynamic linking — preserves LGPL compliance,
and what obligations (if any) that places on npm consumers who receive only the compiled binary
(e.g. re-linking rights, source-availability requirements).

**Why:** This is a legal/compliance question, not an engineering one. LGPL's linking provisions
were written with dynamic linking primarily in mind; native Node addons are commonly built as
statically-linked binaries for distribution simplicity, which is exactly the scenario LGPL
compliance questions get raised about.

**Pros:** Resolving this before the first public release avoids a compliance problem discovered
after publication, when it's much harder to unwind.

**Cons:** Needs actual legal/licensing input — an engineering review (this one) is not the right
venue to resolve it unilaterally, only to flag it.

**Context:** `50-repo-and-tooling.md` §1 states the license is LGPL-3.0-or-later (mandatory per
`AGENTS.md`) but doesn't address linking mode. `ifcopenshell-python` already ships compiled
binaries under the same license today (worth checking how that precedent handles this question, if
at all, before assuming it's already settled).

**Depends on / blocked by:** Should be resolved before Phase 0's first public prebuilt-binary
publish; does not block earlier planning or Phase 0/1 engineering work.
